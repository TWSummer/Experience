Xperience is a web application that allows users to create, share, and vote on experiences. We are inundated with reviews for restaurants, hikes, venues, but simply planning your days based on star ratings lead to disjointed and unmemorable experiences. By allowing users to provide context for their curated activities, we believe that the experiences shared on our application are more than the sum of their parts, and we are excited to share these experiences with the wider world.
